/**
 * TODO: Implement this class.
 *
 * The orchestrator is the brain of the system. It ties together
 * the DAG resolver, step queue, result queue, and pod manager.
 *
 * submitWorkflow(workflow):
 *   1. Store workflow in workflow-store with all steps as PENDING
 *   2. Run getReadySteps() to find immediately runnable steps
 *   3. Push each ready step into the step queue
 *   4. Mark those steps as QUEUED in workflow-store
 *
 * start():
 *   - Begin consuming from the result queue
 *   - Begin draining the step queue (send steps to pod manager)
 *   - For Section 1: sequential is fine
 *   - For Section 2: run parallel dispatch
 *
 * On StepResult received (from result queue consumer):
 *   1. Update the step's status in workflow-store
 *   2. If COMPLETED: run getReadySteps() again, enqueue newly unblocked steps
 *   3. Check if all steps done → update workflow status to "completed" or "failed"
 *
 * INVARIANT: Backend is the ONLY place that writes stepStatus.
 * Pod manager only pushes events. Orchestrator reads events and updates state.
